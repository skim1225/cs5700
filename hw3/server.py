import socket

with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s: #Create a new socket using the given address family,
    # socket type, and protocol number

    #The return value is a pair (conn, address) where conn is a new socket object usable to send and receive data on
    #the connection, and address is the address bound to the socket on the other end of the connection.

                break #breaks out once no more data to receive
            conn.sendall(data) #send the data back to the client (echo it back). The socket must be connected to a remote
            #socket (client's socket).
